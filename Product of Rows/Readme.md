You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the nameNandM

The value stored inNdenotes the number of rows, and the value inMdenotes the number of columns

The 2D array is stored in a variable with the namearr

You have to print the product of all elements in a row, on a new line

For example, consider the value stored inN = 3,M = 2, and the array isarr = [1,2],[3,4],[5,6], then the required output will be

1  (the elements of the row [1,2])
12 (the elements of the row [3,4])
30 (the elements of the row [5,6])

```
Sample Input 1 

3 2
1 2
3 4
5 6
Sample Output 1

2
12
30
```


```
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 3,M = 2, and the array isarr = [1,2],[3,4],[5,6], then the required output will be
1  (the elements of the row [1,2])
12 (the elements of the row [3,4])
30 (the elements of the row [5,6])
```
