You are given an array A of n elements. Write a programme that processes the elements of the array and generates a string from the elements present in the array.

For instance: If elements of the array are 3 5 0 9 8 => the output string should be "35098" (without quotes). But in case of elements are negative (lesser than 0), your string should contain 0 instead of that number.

Suppose elements of the array are 2 -4 6 8 -9, the string generated should be 20680 because -4 and -9 are negative elements, so your string contains 0 instead of that number.
