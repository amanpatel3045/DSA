You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the following names

max, min

You have to print all the numbers from min to max, excluding max. Print each number on a new line

For example, if the value stored inmax = 19, and the value stored inmin = 14, then the output will be

14
15
16
17
18

Note : The value stored in max will always be greater than or equal to min
