You are given an array, stored in a variable with the namearr

The size of the array is stored in a variable with the namesize

You have to print the reverse traversal of the array

For example, consider the value stored insize = 4, and the array isarr = [1 2 3 4]. Then, the required output will be

4 3 2 1
