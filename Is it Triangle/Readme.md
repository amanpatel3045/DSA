Description

Given the lengths of 3 sticks, find out if it is possible to form a triangle of a positive area. (Non-Degenerate Triangle).


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers a,b,c (1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100) — the lengths of the 3 sticks.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: "Yes" if possible, else "No".
