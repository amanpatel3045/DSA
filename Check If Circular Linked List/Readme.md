## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function isCircular() which checks if the given linked list is circular or not. It should return true or false accordingly. (the driver code prints 1 if the returned values is true, otherwise 0)

```
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
Output: 1


```

## Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
## Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
