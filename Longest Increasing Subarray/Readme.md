Description

Given an array A with n integers, find out the length of the longest subarray which is strictly increasing i.e, every element is greater than it's the previous element in that subarray.

Expected Time Complexity O(n^2) for each array.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100).


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The length of the longest subarray.
