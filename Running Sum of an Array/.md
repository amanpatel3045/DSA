You are given an arrayAcontaining N integers, find the running sum of the array.

The running sum of the array is defined as the sum of all the elements of the array that exists before the current element, including the current element

Refer the sample I/O for better understanding


```
In the sample test case, the array has 5 elements. For each element, we have to find the sum of all the elements that exist before it, and include the current element as well

Therefore, for all the elements, the sum becomes

index - 0->{1 = 1}

index - 1->{1 + 2 = 3}

index - 2->{1 + 2 + 3 = 6}

index - 3->{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10}

index - 4->{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15}



```
