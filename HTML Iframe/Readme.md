The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
  
  ```
  Syntax
<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>
  ```
  
  Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is.
