You are given an array, whose size is stored in a variable with the nameN

The array is stored in a variable with the namearr

You have to find the sum of all the elements of the array which are unique.

For example, consider the value stored inN = 7, and the value stored inarr = [3,5,3,3,8,5,6]. Since there are two numbers that are unique i.e 8 and 6.

Then the required output will be8+6 = 14, which is the required output


```
In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 7, and the value stored inarr = [3 5 3 3 8 5 6].

8 occurs 1 time
6 occurs 1 time
5 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 3 times


Thus the required output will be 8 + 6 = 14

```
