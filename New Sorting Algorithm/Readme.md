Hassan has discovered his own sorting algorithm. The algorithm has following conditions:

1. Given an integer k,  sort the values in the array according to their modulo with k. That is, if there are two integers a and b, and a%k < b%k, then a would come before b in the sorted array.

2. If a%k = b%k, then the integer which comes first in the given array remains first in the sorted array.

Your task is to write a program that sorts the given array as per above mentioned condition and print the sorted array.
