You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the nameNandM

The value stored inNdenotes the number of rows, and the value inMdenotes the number of columns

The 2D array is stored in a variable with the namearr

For all columns, you have to print the sum of even elements present in the column

For example, consider the value stored inN = 3,M = 3, and the array isarr = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9], then the required output will be

4  (Even numbers in the column are, [4]. Therefore, the sum becomes 4)
10 (Even numbers in the row are, [2,8]. Therefore, the sum becomes 10) 
6  (Even numbers in the row are, [6]. Therefore, the sum becomes 6)
