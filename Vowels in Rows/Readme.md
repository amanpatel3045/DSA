You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the nameNandM

The value stored inNdenotes the number of rows, and the value inMdenotes the number of columns

The 2D array is stored in a variable with the namearr, and contains lower case English characters

You have to printYes, if any particular row of a 2D array contains at least one vowel, at least printNo

For example, consider the value stored inN = 3,M = 2, and the array isarr = [a,b],[c,d],[e,f], then the required output will be

Yes (This row contains the vowel a)
No  (This row does not contains any vowel)
Yes (This row contains the vowel e)
